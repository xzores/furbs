 * @file server.h
 * @brief WebSocket server implementation
 *
 * This file implements a non-blocking, multiplexing, multithreaded WebSocket
 * server using the libuv library. The server consists of a main networking
 * thread that runs the libuv loop to handle socket I/O, and a pool of worker
 * threads that process the data.
 *
 * The networking thread evenly distributes incoming data from clients to the
 * worker threads using a synchronized queue. The worker threads process the
 * data and may send back replies. The server maintains two queues: a request
 * queue that transfers incoming client data to the worker threads for
 * processing, and a response queue that transfers data from the worker threads
 * back to the network thread for sending it back to the client.
 *
 * The data items are stored in a generic structure called vws_svr_data, which
 * holds the data and the associated connection. The worker threads retrieve
 * data from the request queue and perform the following steps:
 *
 *     1. Assemble data into WebSocket frames.
 *     2. Assemble frames into WebSocket messages.
 *     3. Assemble WebSocket messages into VRTQL messages.
 *     4. Pass the messages to a user-defined processing function.
 *
 * The processing function can optionally produce data to send back to the
 * client.
 *
 * From a programming standpoint, the server architecture simplifies to
 * implementing two functions that run in the context of a worker thread:
 *
 *     - process(request message): Process incoming messages.
 *     - send(reply message): Send back reply messages.
 *
 * The server takes care of all the serialization, handling the communication
 * between the network thread and worker threads. Developers only need to focus
 * on the processing logic.
 *
 * The number of worker threads is configurable, allowing you to adjust it based
 * on workload or system requirements.

/**
 * @struct address_pool
 * @brief Manages a dynamically resizable pool of addresses.
 *
 * The address_pool structure is designed to handle a collection of memory
 * addresses. It is a dynamically resizable array that works like ring
 * buffer. It supports efficient addition, lookup and removal of items while
 * automatically handling memory resizing based on usage. It's main use is to
 * track and identify connections. It is significantly faster a hashtable which
 * provided much better overall server performance.
 *
 * Connections change over time and for the most part keep moving forward in the
 * ring buffer in a sort of statistical distribtion. By the time it reachs the
 * end of the ring to wrap around, all previous connections at the beginning
 * have most likely disconnected.
 *
 * @details
 *
 * - The pool grows in capacity by a specified growth factor each time the array
 *   reaches its current capacity limit. This growth behavior helps in managing
 *   memory more efficiently by minimizing the number of memory reallocations
 *   required as the number of items grows.
 *
 * - The implementation uses a ring buffer approach with a last used index to
 *   optimize the search for free slots, allowing for O(1) time complexity for
 *   addition in most cases, barring the necessity for resizing.
